# Flight Analysis
 Python parser (specifically Kayak.co.uk). Person input a date range, departure airport, and destination airport and analyse route with providing a dataframe for each flight, link for scraped website, and a graph with cheapest average and maximum ticket price for each day in the given range. As this programme use web scraping it takes some time to collect data, specifically around 15 seconds for each day to let a website fully upload without missing a data and in case of slow internet connection. Unfortunately, sometimes captcha can be invoked (only in big amount of data scraped e.x. 60 days range). Even though additional parameter was given with a usage of user agent, avoid invoking big portions of data after each other.
